About:
Imageview is an image gallery script, written by Jorge Schrauwen.
It is free for non-commercial usage. If you sell, include it in a package you sell or
somehow make money with it you need to donate (http://www.blackdot.be/?page=donate.htm).
or you can e-mail me and I'll give my premission in some cases.
